# Daily Coding Practices

A series of coding challenges and algorithms practiced daily to improve problem-solving skills, algorithmic thinking, and coding fluency in Kotlin programming languages.

- [Acronym](https://exercism.org/tracks/kotlin/exercises/acronym)
  A program that takes a phrase or a string of words and returns the acronym formed by the initial letters of each word. Useful for simplifying long phrases into more manageable forms.
- [Armstrong Number](https://exercism.org/tracks/kotlin/exercises/armstrong-numbers) 
  A number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. For example, 153 is an Armstrong number because 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153.
- [Bubble Sort]() 
   A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The process is repeated until the list is sorted.
- [Circular Buffer](https://exercism.org/tracks/kotlin/exercises/circular-buffer)
  A data structure that efficiently handles a fixed-size buffer and uses the concept of wrapping around. It allows for continuous writing and reading of data in a circular fashion, often used in scenarios like streaming data or handling buffer overflow.
- [Custom Set](https://exercism.org/tracks/kotlin/exercises/custom-set)
  An implementation of a set data structure that supports the basic operations of adding, removing, and checking membership without duplicates. It can be customized to meet specific requirements or constraints.
- [D&D Character](https://exercism.org/tracks/kotlin/exercises/dnd-character)
  A program to generate or manage characters for Dungeons & Dragons (D&D), including random stat generation, class selection, and equipment. The goal is to help streamline the character creation process.
- [Square Code](https://exercism.org/tracks/kotlin/exercises/crypto-square)
  An algorithm that arranges a given string or set of numbers into a square matrix or grid format. The resulting grid may be used for various applications like cryptography or image processing.
